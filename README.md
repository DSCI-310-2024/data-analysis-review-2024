# MDS Data analysis peer review 2021-22

This repository is the home to the UBC Master of [Data Science Workflows course](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_dsci-workflows) open peer review. In this course students work in teams to build data analysis projects using R and Python, and perform open peer review of the projects they develop. To do this, the students follow the peer review process inspired by the  [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) and [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/), for the R and Python packages, respectively.
